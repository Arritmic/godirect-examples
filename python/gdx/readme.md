# The gdx Module

The `gdx` module in this folder is used to abstract and simplify interaction with Go DirectÂ® devices. While the implementation of the communication is actually done through the lower level [godirect module](https://pypi.org/project/godirect/), the `gdx` module exposes the features that are most commonly used when writing code that deals with Go Direct devices.

The godirect-examples for python use the `gdx` module. Therefore, the `gdx` module must be placed in a directory that can be found when running the examples. Placing the gdx folder in the same directory as the examples usually insures that the python script will find the `gdx` module.

Modify the `gdx` module as needed for your own custom Go Direct sensor examples.
